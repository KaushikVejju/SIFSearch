# SIF Search (Proof of Concept)
SIFSearch is a search engine designed for the Smith Investment Fund, a student-run organization at the University of Maryland. This application aims to provide members of the club with a more streamlined way of searching for quantitative finance related material, whether it be articles, Jupyter notebooks, and past projects that club members have completed.

As of now, a basic template of the application has been created. Users are limited to only uploading and searching for media in the form of links. This is Django-based application that uses Algolia's Search API to search for a desired entry.
